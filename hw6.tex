1) {\bf a) Understand Language} 
E: sentences input in a given manner to the machine are parsed and a model of the information contained in those sentences is generated. Tracking wether the model is accurate or inaccurate.
P: fraction of sentences for which the machine was able to create a accurate model of the information. 

This doesn't fit as well into the supervised learning framework as it is hard to be the teacher; specifically, you have to be able to validate the information models that should be produced.  Additionally, you would get better results if you were able to determine how close a model was to the correct.
{\bf b) Playing Tennis} E: play games against an opponent tracking wins and losses as well as your actions and their actions. P: fraction of games won.
This fits well into the supervised learning framework we have been studying because it is possible to determine or at least estimate the effect that an action had on the outcome of the game.
